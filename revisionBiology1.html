                    <p>Peroxisomes are organelles that break down fatty acids and detoxify harmful substances, like hydrogen peroxide, using enzymes. They protect cells from oxidative damage and contribute to lipid metabolism.</p>

                    <p>Diploid refers to a cell with two sets of chromosomes (2n), one from each parent, found in most body cells. It ensures genetic stability and provides two copies of each gene for trait expression.</p>

                    <p>Genetic engineering in agriculture involves modifying crop DNA to enhance traits like pest resistance or drought tolerance, e.g., Bt corn produces a bacterial toxin to deter pests. This increases yield and reduces pesticide use.</p>

                    <p>Developing a new medicine involves identifying a target (e.g., a disease-causing protein), screening compounds, testing in labs and animals, conducting clinical trials in humans (phases I-III), and obtaining regulatory approval to ensure safety and efficacy.</p>

                    <p>An adaptation is a trait that enhances an organism's survival and reproduction in its environment, developed through natural selection. For example, a camel's hump stores fat for energy in deserts.</p>
